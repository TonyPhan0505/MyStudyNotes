# MyStudyNotes
Please run this with Python 3.8.
A simple web app made by myself (inspired by TechWithTim) to take study notes using Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS, Javascript.
There's much more to come: more fonts, uploading images and videos, create tables, make lists, special features for creating plans for events.
